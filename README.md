# Pendulum
Basic simulation of the movement of a pendulum

## Note
This is a little java applet based simulation of a pendulum, made as an applet which I wrote back in 1998. Lost and found, and moved to github in case it is useful for somebody.

## Compiling (tested on Linux only)
```
javac doppelpendela.java
javac doppelpendel.java
```
## Running

appletviewer doppelpendel.html
```
